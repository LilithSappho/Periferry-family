If you are wondering what Periferry is, lemme tell you :
You aren't lucky to experience that 1.5 months!
Basically Periferry is an organization that works for the upliftment of the trans community by placing them.
I enrolled in the March 2022 Batch and completed the one and a half month training. 
Did I get a job? Idk. Am writing this on 14 June 2022 and am still unemployed. 
But I met 17 amazing people in my batch and they were all trans like me! All those days were amazing.
And I felt hard-crush on a boy for the first time and I opened about it to him. But he rejected like it's nothing. Ouch!
